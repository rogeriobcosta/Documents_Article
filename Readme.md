This repository contains the data collected in the experiments for the development of the article Analysis of Energy Consumption Reliability inIoT Network.

The folders Cenarios_Bluetooth, Cenarios_EspNow and Cenarios_WiFi contain the worksheets with the collected data. All of them are organized in the same way.

Within them you will find 8 worksheets with the following name: scenario readings worksheet..........In them are the readings of each of the Esp32, in each of the scenarios, the calculations for the stochastic Markov matrix and the MTTF are also found.

There is also the Markov bar graph worksheet....., it contains the tables used to generate the Markov bar graphs.

And there are also 8 folders with the names of the scenarios that contain the scripts in R to generate the Standard Deviation and its graphs and the Kaplan-Meier estimator.

In the root folders Canarios_50m_WiFi_EspNow_ graficosKM and Cenarios_8m_WiFi_EspNow_Bluetooth_graficosKM, contain the scripts that generated the graph of
survival and Kaplam-Meier with comparisons between scenarios.
